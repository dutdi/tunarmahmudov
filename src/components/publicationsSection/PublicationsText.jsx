        My research centers on sustainability-aware recommender systems, user
        modeling, and decision-support algorithms in the context of responsible
        tourism. The resulting publications, featured in peer-reviewed venues
        such as ACM and Springer JITT, address composite sustainability
        indicators, user interface influence on decision-making, and data-driven
        optimization for environmentally conscious travel recommendations.
